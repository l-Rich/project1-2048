2048 is not your grandmothers math game. Its addicting and challenging to reach the 2048th square! 

To start the game two cells will be filled with a starter value- a two!

From there you will then use the keyboard arrows to make a move
left will shift all the cells to the left.
right will shift all the cells to the right. 

You get it?

As the cells are shifting, if there is a cell with the same number next to each other the numbers will be combined into one cell

The game is over once one cell equals 2048 or there are no more moves that can legally be made

Can you reach 2048?!
