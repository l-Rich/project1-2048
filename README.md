# project1-2048

User story:

When a player starts the game two cells will be filled with starter values (2 or 4)

The player will then use the keyboard arrows to make a move
    left will shift all the cells to the left. If there is a cell with the same number next to each other the numbers will be combined into one cell

    the same thing will happen if the player selects up down or right

<<<<<<< HEAD
The game is over once one cell equals 2048 or there are no more moves that can legally be made
